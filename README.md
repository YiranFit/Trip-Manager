# Trip Manager

Trip Manager is a dynamic and user-friendly full stack application built on the powerful Django and React frameworks, with data managed and stored using Postgres database system. With Trip Manager, users can manage their trips from start to finish, with features designed to make trip planning easier than ever before. Additionally, I integrated two third-party APIs, Google Map API, and Travel Adviser from RapidApi, to provide users with additional features like finding restaurants and hotels at their travel destinations or any other locations. These features are designed to enhance the user experience and make trip planning more convenient.
